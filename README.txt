This app helps you track changes in your Homey system, including user alarms, applications, capabilities, devices, flows, logic, users, weather, and zones. The tracked changes can be outputted in various ways: flows for each audit, data stored in message format (zipped daily and kept for 14 days), detailed information (zipped daily and kept for 3 days), using Third party integrations like BetterStack, or with the SimpleLog app.

Betterstack is by far the best method! Go to Betterstack and create a new account, then just add the "id" to the app.

All your audit logs will be available directly within Betterstack,. The free account will keep the data for 3 days.
